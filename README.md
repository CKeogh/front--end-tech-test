title: Real-World Front-end Task
client: utility design

Intro
--
In order to test your initiative as well as your practical skills as a front-end developer we would like you to provide a response to a "real world" problem.


Context
--
We are currently in the early prototyping stage for a redevelopment of a page on utilitydesign.co.uk. The goal of the redevelopment is to improve the usability and customer experience for the process of buying a configurable product with multiple options.

Members of our Design and UX team have created hi-fidelity artwork showing a proposed redesign of a single product page within the utility website. The next stage of the process is for the "flat" mockups to be turned into a functioning prototype so that we can perform some user testing prior to the changes being presented to the client and published.


Task
--
We would like you to create a working prototype using a combination of HTML, SCSS/CSS and Javascript.

The response should be sent as a zip file containing all assets and be able to be ran standalone. The site header is included as a reference, as well as the image gallery. Don't worry too much about these elements since they are not the focus of the task (but feel free to wow us)

Qualities we are looking for in the response include but are not limited to;
- Responsiveness - your implementation should work at different screen sizes
- Code Frugality - evidence of an understanding of how to use code sparingly, avoiding use of big libraries unnecessarily
- Ingenuity / Flair - as well as being functional, an effort should be made to make the experience delightful
- Cross-browser Functionality - the solution must work well across all modern browsers, and fail gracefully on older browsers (but still remain usable in some capacity)
