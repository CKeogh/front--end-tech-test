# Igoo Tech-test - Utility Design

## Running the code in the browser
To view the finished page copy the *index.html* path - located in the views directory - and paste it into the browser. No third-party libraries have been used in the implementation of the web page so there is no need to install any extra packages before running.

## Directory Structure

The main HTML file can be found in the views directory, the assets directory contains all image files, and the CSS content is all included in the styles directory. 
There are two JavaScript files in the scripts directory. *api.js* contains some basic functions that are supposed to extract some of the repetition away from the *index.html* and simulate a request for data from the backend api.

In the *script.js* is all of main code for the form. As stated above, no third-party libraries have been used so everything should be good to go as is.
