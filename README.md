# Igoo Tech-test - Utility Design

This is my attempt at the Igoo tech-test in which we are expected to implement a new design for a single page of the Utility website.

## Running the code in the browser
To view the finished page copy the index.html path - located in the views directory - and paste it into the browser. Alternatively, if using a Linux operating system, simply navigate to the views directory in the terminal and run the following command: 
```
sensible-browser index.html
```
